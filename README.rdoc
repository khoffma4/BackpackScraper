== Backpack Scraper

I built this to save our groups backpack pages before we lost access to them.

To use it for yourself, you must run the loadpages rake file with the appropriate backpack url and username/pw probably stored as ENVs.

PLEASE NOTE: this does not save any files hosted by backpackit.com.  You will have to modify the code or manually download all files hosted on backpackit.com
